*mscgetcatalog* 
- returns a lot of garbage points when using usnob1 catalog.  
- Galaxies are included, and nearby galaxies are shredded into multiple sources.  
- Not sure how to fix this yet.  
- Some have a magnitude listed as 99 - could try getting rid of all these.
- want to use a smaller magnitude range - trying 12-16 - returned 307 objects - this still gave an error when running msccmatch

*msctvmark* 
- use this to display the catalog results

  display hftr7134t0040o00.fits 1
  msctvmark coords=t0040.v7.cat frame=1 wcs='world' radii=15


*msczero* 
-seems to work ok in pyraf after running 
       set disable_wcs_maps=""
       flpr


*msccmatch* 
- keep getting floating point error when it is ready to write the solution
- Adriana Durbala's reduction guide says to shorten the length of the catalog


* need to create bpm for cosmic rays - there a lot of them!



INSTALLING IRAF 2.16 from source

following notes from here:  ftp://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/v216/README

sudo mkdir /home/iraf/
sudo wget ftp://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/v216/PCIX/iraf-src.tar.gz
sudo tar xvf iraf-src.tar.gz 


su -
export iraf=/home/iraf/
export IRAFARCH=linux64


sudo chgrp

sudo chown 
setenv iraf /home/iraf/
source $iraf/unix/hlib/irafuser.csh
make linux64
man ln
sudo ln -s /iraf /home
man ln
sudo ln -s /home /iraf
ls /
ls /iraf/iraf/
make linux64
make sysgen
which gcc
sudo aptitude search gcc
sudo aptitude install gcc


starting again, making iraf userd

need to install f77

ABANDON ALL HOPE - GOING BACK TO SCAMP AND SWARP!!!


*******************************************

INSTALLING SCAMP

downloaded install file to mac, unpacked, and then copied to coma

sudo aptitude install gfortran

sudo aptitude install cpufrequtils


** ATLAS

cd software/ATLAS
mkdir builddir
cd builddir
../configure --help

sudo ../configure
sudo make

running - according to install guide (atlas_install.pdf), this could take a loooong time.  
started around 10:24 am.  finished around 10:35. - not too bad


sudo make check  # run some checks, optional - return no fails - yay!

- double precision timings look good.  Single precision - not so much.  
- the install manual says the present should be w/in a few percent of reference, and this is mostly the case.
- not going to mess with this.

sudo make install
 - got errors on dynamic libraries *dll files - b/c they weren't built. hopefully this is ok.
 - if not, I will have to reinstall with dll option enabled



** CDSclient

- no package in aptitude
- downloaded tar file from http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/pub/sw/cdsclient.tar.gz to ~/software directory
- in software directory
     tar xvfz cdsclient.tar.gz 
- cd cdsclient-3.83/
- sudo ./configure
- sudo make
- sudo make install

(that was easy...)



** FFTW v3.0
- there is an aptitude package for this
- sudo aptitude install fftw3

** PLPLOT V5.9 or above
- http://plplot.sourceforge.net/
- looks like there are packages for this as well - 24 are listed under jessie
- installed a few options - not sure if I got everything I need. 
- will be able to tell if this is sufficient if we are able to generate diagnostic plots

** scamp!

- cd ~/software/scamp-2.0.4
- looking at instructions in INSTALL file
- do i want to build with multi-thread capabilities?

- error - fftw3.h filtes not found in default location

sudo aptitude install liblapack-3.so



sudo apt-file search fftw3.h



###############

SWARP

sudo aptitude remove swarp



wget http://www.astromatic.net/download/swarp/swarp-2.38.0.tar.gz
tar xvfz swarp-2.38.0.tar.gz
cd swarp-2.38.0


#############

scamp and swarp are now installed on coma

FINE TUNING SCAMP CONFIG FILE

* Comparing results from SDSSDR9 and GSC-2.3
- ran a test case w/A1367-h02 using both catalogs

- downloading image from digitized sky survey to serve as astrometric reference
https://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss_form

   - POSS2 Red
   - 60 x 60 arcmin
   - 11:46:12, 19:35:45
   - downloaded on macbook
   - copied to coma

$$$ conclusion = GSC-2.3 does a better job with the astrometric correction; 
--- the distortion-corrected images made using SDSSDR9 are really off at the edge of the coadded image

* decrease error in projection angle to 1.5 deg and center offset to 7 arcmin


IS WCS PRECESSION CORRECT?

using http://cxc.harvard.edu/toolkit/precess.jsp to check precession of RA and Dec from epoch
2015.3 to 2000.0

image: cftr7135t0052o00.fits
RA: +11:47:00.8
Dec: +19:31:08
Epoch: 2015.30642

output
-------
RA: 11 46 13.41
176.555861

Dec: +19 36 13.95
19.603874

After running fix header, 

RA = 176.753333
Dec = 19.503954

So this is wrong.  RA is off by 0.2 degrees!

First, try running scamp using 2015.3 coordinates
