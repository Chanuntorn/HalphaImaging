*mscgetcatalog* 
- returns a lot of garbage points when using usnob1 catalog.  
- Galaxies are included, and nearby galaxies are shredded into multiple sources.  
- Not sure how to fix this yet.  
- Some have a magnitude listed as 99 - could try getting rid of all these.
- want to use a smaller magnitude range - trying 12-16 - returned 307 objects - this still gave an error when running msccmatch

*msctvmark* 
- use this to display the catalog results

  display hftr7134t0040o00.fits 1
  msctvmark coords=t0040.v7.cat frame=1 wcs='world' radii=15


*msczero* 
-seems to work ok in pyraf after running 
       set disable_wcs_maps=""
       flpr


*msccmatch* 
- keep getting floating point error when it is ready to write the solution
- Adriana Durbala's reduction guide says to shorten the length of the catalog


* need to create bpm for cosmic rays - there a lot of them!
